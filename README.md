This is an example site that would be made for a company. I made it to learn how to create a backend using nodejs and mongodb. I also used Amazone s3 to store different  images and set up the s3 bucket to create a temp. link each time it gets a get request. 

As for the frontend it was made using create react app and i used functional components and hooks for all of the site.

note: the current authintocation is made using env variables in the server 
I plan on adding a system for Authentication and athurization in the future as my next step.
